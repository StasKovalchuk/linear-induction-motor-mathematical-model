# Mathematical model of a linear engine with a classical method of stacking a stator winding.

A linear induction motor with the number of grooves of the inductor equal to 6 (z1 = 6) is the object of study. The mathematical model is implemented in the MATLAB software environment.

To work with the model:
1. Open it in your software. 
2. Change the equivalent circuit parameters to yours. 
3. Click Run.
4. Choose the duration of the cycle.
